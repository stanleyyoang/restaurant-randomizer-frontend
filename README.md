# restaurant-randomizer-frontend

Running on Android Studio and using Pixel 2 XL API 29 as virtual device.

Follow the instructions in the following link to set up the Android Emulator:

Because the application only runs in an emulator currently, it is not able to properly pass the user parameters to the backend server correctly. Please look at the backend GitHub repository to look at how to actually retrieve results from the Google Places API. 

The location services also do not work fully as intended because the emulator does not support that capability.
